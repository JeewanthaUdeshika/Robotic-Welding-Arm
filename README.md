# Robotic-Welding-Arm
This report presents the development and simulation of a robotic welder using Coppelia Sim software and Python programming language. The system is capable of detecting welding joints through a vision sensor, executing motion and path planning, completing the welding pass, and retracting to a safe home position. The implementation of this project utilizes Python image processing to detect the welding joints accurately. The simulation results show that the system can accurately perform the required tasks and ensure safety. The developed robotic welder provides an efficient and effective solution for welding joints on parts in industrial applications.
